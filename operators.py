#"or " operation
e = True or False#if atleast 1 is true then it gives true

#"and" operation
f = True and True#if both are true or both are false then only it gives it as true or false

g = True and False#both are not true and hence it gives false
print(g)
#"not" operation
print(not(True))#it makes the true operation false and false operation as true
