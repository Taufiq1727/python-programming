# Python Learning Journey 🐍

This repository documents my **Python learning journey**, from fundamentals to problem-solving and practical use cases.  
The goal is simple: **build strong basics, write clean code, and improve consistently**.

No fluff. No copied tutorials. Everything here is either **learned, practiced, or built by me**.

## 📌 What This Repo Contains

- Core Python fundamentals  
- Practice problems and solutions  
- Logic-building exercises  
- Small scripts and experiments
